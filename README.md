# Any-Year-Console-Calendar-Cpp

C++ Console Calendar that creates a quick and easy console calendar by just typing the date.

Most of the operations are done manually with exception of knowing the starting day of the year (time.h helped on this)

## Potential Improvements
Add First WeekDay of the year manual calculation

## How to Run
Option 1: Compile .cpp with MSVC of G++
Option 2: Run .exe for a quick demo
